# Pal-Breeding-Calculator

A  Palworld-Breeding-Calculator

Most people don't care what they get when two pals are bred as there are close to 20,000 combinations. People are more concerned about: when I want a certain pal, how do I get it. The second function can help give all the parent combinations of a specific pal.
A planed function is to calculate the fastest breeding solution based on the current pal resources. This is obviously an unweighted shortest path graph problem.

#### Todo:

1. Create a mapping table include NO.  - power - name(cn) - name -en

2. Function 1 Calculate NO. of child with parents(general calculation and special cases)

3. Function 2 a program to output all parrent combinations 

4. Function 3 Output best solution to breed the specified pal based on pals you have
   
#### Current function

1. Calculate child of parents selected(general calculation and special cases)
2. Select a pal you want output all parrent combinations
